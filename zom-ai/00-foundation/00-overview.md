# Foundation Zone

This zone captures the **intent** that precedes and informs all architecture decisions for Zom AI. Read this first to understand why the system exists and the constraints that shape it.

## Contents

```

├── 00-overview.md      ← You are here
├── 10-purpose.md       # Why Zom AI exists
├── 20-principles.md    # Design heuristics
└── 30-boundaries.md    # What Zom AI won't do
```

## Navigation

- **[Purpose](10-purpose.md)** — The problem Zom AI solves and who it serves
- **[Principles](20-principles.md)** — Decision-making heuristics that apply everywhere
- **[Boundaries](30-boundaries.md)** — What the system explicitly will NOT do
