# Purpose: Why Zom AI Exists

## Problem Statement

Financial advisors need contextual AI assistance when managing client portfolios and providing advice. They work with:
- Household data (holdings, allocations, account types)
- Investment Policy Statements (IPS) defining client goals
- Market data for tickers and securities
- Tasks and to-dos related to client management

Without Zom AI, advisors would need to manually context-switch between multiple data sources when formulating advice.

## Who It Serves

**Primary Users**: Financial advisors using the Zom dashboard

Advisors use Zom AI to:
- Research tickers and market conditions
- Analyze client portfolios in context
- Generate advice grounded in actual household data
- Track and discuss client-related tasks

**Secondary Users**: Operations teams and internal support staff

## Value Proposition

Zom AI provides a contextual AI assistant that:

1. **Understands household context** — The agent can access and reason about a specific household's holdings, allocations, and IPS
2. **Uses tool-driven context loading** — Instead of pre-loading everything, the agent requests the data it needs through tools
3. **Streams responses in real-time** — Advisors see responses as they generate, not after completion
4. **Syncs state with the UI** — What the agent loads appears in the right sidebar for visual reference

The result: Advisors get AI assistance that knows about their clients, can pull relevant data on demand, and shows its work through the UI.

## Key Insight

Zom AI is not a general-purpose chatbot — it's a **domain-specific assistant** built for the financial advisory workflow. Every architectural decision flows from this focus on the advisor use case.
